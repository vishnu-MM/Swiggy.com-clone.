# Swiggy.com-clone.
This GitHub repository contains my clone project of Swiggy's homepage, developed using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I aimed to practice and improve my web design skills by replicating the design and layout of Swiggy's website. This clone serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in HTML structure and CSS styling.
